NOTE: This full configuration utilizes the [Terraform http provider](https://www.terraform.io/docsx/providers/http/index.html) to call out to icanhazip.com to determine your local workstation external IP for easily configuring EC2 Security Group access to the Kubernetes servers. Feel free to replace this as necessary.
